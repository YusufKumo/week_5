const hospital = {name:"Kumo Medical Clinic", location:"Kumo", address:"along Gombe to Yola road",

document.getElementById("yusmin").innerHTML = hospital.name + " is located in " + hospital.location + " " + hospital.address + " with " + hospital.serviceHours + ".";


let m = 3
let n = 3
let x=m+n
documet.getElementById('yusmin').innerText = x;

<p> I tried all other means to show the rest of the learning outcome; objects, function, comparisons, booleans etc. but unfortunately,
