<h2>Week 5 learning outcome</h2>
<p id="yusmin"></p>

<script>
const hospital = {name:"Kumo Medical Clinic", location:"Kumo", address:"along Gombe to Yola road",
 serviceHours:"24 Hours"
}

document.getElementById("yusmin").innerHTML = hospital.name + " is located in " + hospital.location + " " + hospital.address + " with " + hospital.serviceHours + ".";


let m = 3
let n = 3
let x=m+n
documet.getElementById('yusmin').innerText = x;
</script>

<p> I tried all other means to show the rest of the learning outcome; objects, function, comparisons, booleans etc. but unfortunately,
    they're not displaying despite watching several videos on how to merge multiple JavaScript functions in one script, <strong> I need a mentor to guide me</strong>.
